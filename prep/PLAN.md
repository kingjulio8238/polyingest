# PolyIngest Alpha Detection Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of PolyIngest, an advanced alpha detection service for Polymarket prediction markets. The system uses comprehensive market data analysis and multi-agent intelligence to identify trading opportunities ("alpha") by analyzing trader behavior, success rates, and portfolio allocation patterns.

## Current State Analysis

Based on the codebase review, the project currently exists as documentation and planning files only:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive project specification with API designs and architecture
- `README.md` - High-level project overview and development instructions
- `RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Research methodology template for codebase analysis
- No actual implementation exists yet

### Key Constraints Discovered:
- Starting from scratch - no existing codebase
- Must integrate with Polymarket's GraphQL API (`https://clob.polymarket.com/graphql`)
- Must handle Polygon blockchain data for portfolio analysis
- Requires multi-agent architecture for alpha detection
- Target deployment on Vercel, Render, or Heroku

## Desired End State

A fully functional FastAPI-based alpha detection service with:
- Three main API endpoints for market data, alpha analysis, and trader analysis
- Multi-agent system with specialized analysis agents
- Real-time market data integration from Polymarket
- On-chain portfolio analysis using Polygon blockchain
- Redis caching and PostgreSQL storage
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- Production-ready deployment configuration

### Verification Criteria:
- All API endpoints return valid JSON responses matching specification
- Alpha detection successfully identifies high-conviction traders (>10% allocation, >70% success rate)
- System handles concurrent requests with sub-second response times
- Agent consensus mechanism functions correctly

## What We're NOT Doing

- Frontend/UI development (API-only service)
- Real money trading or financial advice
- Historical backtesting beyond validation
- Multi-chain support (Polygon only)
- Custom blockchain node infrastructure
- Real-time streaming (polling-based updates)

## Implementation Approach

We'll build this incrementally, starting with core infrastructure and data retrieval, then adding the multi-agent system and alpha detection logic. Each phase will be fully testable before moving to the next.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Agent functionality and voting mechanisms
- Data client API interactions (mocked)
- Alpha detection algorithm accuracy
- Portfolio analysis calculations
- Database operations and caching

### Integration Tests:
- End-to-end API workflows
- Real Polymarket API integration (with rate limiting)
- Blockchain data retrieval with test addresses
- Agent coordination and consensus building

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Test alpha detection with known high-performing Polymarket traders
2. Verify API performance under realistic load conditions
3. Validate alpha criteria thresholds (>10% allocation, >70% success rate)
4. Test error handling with invalid market IDs and trader addresses
5. Verify data consistency between cached and real-time data

## Performance Considerations

- Implement connection pooling for database and Redis
- Use async/await throughout for I/O operations
- Cache frequently accessed market data (5-minute TTL)
- Batch blockchain queries to reduce RPC calls
- Implement request rate limiting for external APIs
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing

## Migration Notes

Since this is a new implementation, no data migration is required. However, consider:
- Environment variable migration from development to production
- Database schema versioning from the start
- Cache warming strategies for production deployment
- API key rotation procedures
