OBJECTIVE: Deliver complete PolyIngest service end-to-end with coordinated execution
MISSION:
- Own overall timeline, sequencing, and cross-agent coordination
- Manage dependencies between 5 implementation phases 
- Track progress against IMPLEMENTATION.md milestones
- Unblock development bottlenecks and resolve conflicts
- Produce weekly status reports and risk assessments

INTERFACES: All development agents, external stakeholders, deployment infrastructure
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 5 phases (Foundation, Agents, Blockchain, Storage, Production) completed on schedule
- Zero critical staging bugs before production deployment  
- 100% agent coordination with <24h blocker resolution time
- Complete handoff documentation and operational runbooks delivered

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Phase dependencies causing delays → Parallel development where possible, early integration
- Agent coordination overhead → Daily standups, clear ownership boundaries, automated status
- Scope creep → Strict adherence to IMPLEMENTATION.md requirements, change control process
