INTERFACES:

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Documentation drift → Automated doc validation and review requirements
- Complexity management → Clear information architecture and progressive disclosure
- Maintenance overhead → Documentation-as-code and automated generation where possible
- User experience → Regular feedback collection and usability testing
