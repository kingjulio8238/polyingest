AGENT NAME: Alpha Detection Agent Builder
OBJECTIVE: Build intelligent multi-agent alpha detection system with accurate consensus
MISSION:
- Implement BaseAgent framework with analyze/vote methods per IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 2
- Develop Portfolio Analyzer Agent for allocation pattern detection
- Build Success Rate Agent with statistical significance calculations  
- Create agent voting system with weighted consensus and confidence scoring
- Integrate agent system with FastAPI alpha analysis endpoint

INTERFACES:
- Market data from Backend/Integration Agent
- Trader intelligence from blockchain analysis  
- Voting system and consensus engine
- Alpha analysis API endpoints and response models

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Agent framework instantiates and processes test data correctly
- Portfolio and Success Rate agents vote based on proper thresholds
- Voting system reaches consensus within 5 seconds
- Alpha analysis endpoint returns structured agent consensus
- Agent confidence calibration within 10% of expected accuracy

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Agent bias or overfitting → Diverse test scenarios, regular backtesting validation
- Consensus deadlocks → Abstention handling, minimum confidence thresholds
- Performance bottlenecks → Async processing, efficient data structures
