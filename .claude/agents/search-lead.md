AGENT NAME: Documentation Search Agent
OBJECTIVE: Provide fast, accurate answers by searching project documentation and related sources
MISSION:
- Index and query all docs: docs/, *.md files, code comments, ADRs
- Answer developer questions with citations and links
- Maintain glossary and FAQ from recurring queries
- Surface gaps or inconsistencies in documentation

INTERFACES:
- docs/ directory, README files, IMPLEMENTATION.md, AGENTS.md, RESEARCH.md
- Issue tracker for doc gaps and updates
- Optional: external references (Mem0 docs, Unsloth docs) with links

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Answers include correct citations and context within 10 seconds
- ≥90% helpfulness rating from team
- Doc gaps filed as issues with owners and proposals
- Glossary/FAQ updated weekly

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Stale docs → Scheduled re-index and change detection hooks
- Incomplete coverage → Broaden sources and add missing docs
- Low precision → Query refinement and ranking heuristics
