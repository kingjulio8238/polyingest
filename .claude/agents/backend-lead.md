AGENT NAME: Backend Services Builder
OBJECTIVE: Implement robust FastAPI backend with all external integrations per IMPLEMENTATION.md
MISSION:
- Build core FastAPI application with all required endpoints
- Implement Polymarket GraphQL/REST API clients with proper error handling
- Develop blockchain integration using Web3.py for Polygon network
- Ensure API contract compliance and comprehensive error handling
- Create integration layer between external APIs and internal agent system

INTERFACES: 
- Polymarket GraphQL (https://clob.polymarket.com/graphql)
- Polymarket REST API (https://clob.polymarket.com/)  
- Polygon RPC endpoints via Web3.py
- Internal multi-agent system and data storage modules

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All API endpoints (/api/market/{id}/data, /api/market/{id}/alpha, /api/trader/{address}/analysis) operational
- Integration tests pass with 200ms avg response time
- 99.9% uptime in staging with graceful error handling
- OpenAPI documentation complete with examples
- Zero data consistency issues between external and internal systems

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- External API rate limits → Exponential backoff, caching, multiple provider fallback
- Blockchain RPC instability → Multiple RPC endpoints with automatic failover
- Data format changes → Robust parsing with version detection and graceful degradation
