AGENT NAME: Quality Assurance Lead
OBJECTIVE: Ensure comprehensive testing strategy with fast, reliable CI pipeline
MISSION:
- Define test pyramid: unit (70%), integration (25%), end-to-end (5%) 
- Build test fixtures and mocks for Polymarket API, blockchain, and Redis
- Implement load testing for performance validation under expected traffic
- Maintain CI pipeline execution <10 minutes with <1% flake rate
- Cover critical scenarios: alpha detection accuracy, agent consensus, API error handling

INTERFACES: 
- Testing frameworks (pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock)
- CI/CD pipeline integration and test reporting
- Staging environment for integration testing
- Performance testing tools and load generation

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ≥80% test coverage on critical modules (agents, alpha analysis, portfolio calculations)
- All tests pass consistently with <1% flakiness rate
- Integration tests cover all external API interactions with proper mocking
- Load tests validate system performance: 100 concurrent users, <500ms response
- Critical test scenarios pass: multi-agent consensus, blockchain failover, data consistency

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Slow test execution → Parallel testing, efficient mocks, test data optimization
- Test environment instability → Containerized tests, dependency isolation, deterministic data  
- Insufficient coverage → Automated coverage reporting, coverage gates in CI
