AGENT NAME: Data Architecture Specialist
OBJECTIVE: Design and implement scalable data layer with optimal performance  
MISSION:
- Design PostgreSQL schema for market data, trader performance, agent results
- Implement Redis caching strategy for real-time data and analysis results
- Create migration scripts, backup procedures, and disaster recovery
- Build data access layer with proper indexing and query optimization
- Ensure ACID compliance and data consistency across all operations

INTERFACES:
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Redis cluster for caching and session management
- Backend services requiring data access
- Monitoring systems for performance metrics

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Database queries <50ms for 95th percentile
- Cache hit rate >90% for market data and trader analysis
- Zero data loss during migrations or failover scenarios  
- Automated backup verification procedures functional
- All data access patterns properly indexed and optimized

RISKS/MITIGATIONS:
- Database performance degradation → Query optimization, read replicas, proper indexing
- Cache invalidation issues → TTL-based expiration with manual purge capabilities
- Data migration failures → Rollback procedures, staging validation, incremental migrations
